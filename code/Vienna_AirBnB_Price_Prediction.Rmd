# Introduction  
My task is to help a company offering small and mid-size apartments find the right price for their new AirBnb units in Vienna. I do this by building a model for predicting Airbnb prices with publicly available data from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). We can run the model on the client's apartments to figure out what an appropriate price is for each unit.  
  
The Vienna AirBnb data has approximately 10.000 observations after cleaning and preparation. The **mean price** is about â‚¬68 and the **average number of reviews** is 33. However, 17% of the apartments in the data have 0 reviews, just like the client's properties.

```{r setup}

# set data directories (RMDs always set their own dir as the working dir)
raw_data_dir <- "../data/raw/"
clean_data_dir <- "../data/clean/"

# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(ranger)

# load data
df <- read_csv(paste0(raw_data_dir,'listings.csv.gz'))

```
